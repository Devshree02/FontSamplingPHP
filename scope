The font sampling(jQuery task) with its extended version using PHP.

Note: You need to explore more terms for the task[Html Canvas, file File Reading in php] with existing one [jQuery, js,HTML, css]

#Highlights:

1. We will have 1 new fields in the form 'name' with submit button.
2. Output is now div when selected and image after submit.
3. On submit we will store related details into a CSV file with the current timestamp, filename, name and file uploaded into a directory(we need to create)! the image name will be hard coded image name + latest timestamp eq.  'plate_45353636335645645.png'
4. There will be a listing page like https://tinyurl.com/yef57zov where we will list all the images by reading the CSV file.(not image name only) with their name(entered from form) and uploaded time.
5.Image will be generated from the Html(generated by applied property colour, background-color ..).
